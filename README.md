## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Hover effect
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I've learnt how to properly use media queries, and rebuild your project to make it correct way. Mobile first approach seem optimal when working on the responsiveness.

### Continued development

I would add some pop-up and fade-in animations to the card.
